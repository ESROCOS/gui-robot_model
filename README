####
This package is a fork of https://github.com/rock-gui/gui-robot_model.

The original package depends on gui/control_ui and gui/vizkit. These 
dependencies are removed in this fork. They are not needed in ESROCOS, 
which only uses the C++ library of gui/robot_model.

These two packages depend in turn of many other packages, which would 
unnecessarily increase the size of the ESROCOS install and potentially 
cause build problems.

processes and simplify reuse of this project. 

For build automation the project structure should be parsed and validated
